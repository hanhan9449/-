Was it because the plane misread instruments?Or had a problem navigating.
F> I don't know.
M> Maybe he or she was incapacitated due to an illness.
What kinds of illness.
F> Forget it.

M> Like a lightning strike.
That's not very likely.
F> Okay,how about's some problem with the flight crew that cause the cabin to depressurize.
And the plan to go into a tailspin.
